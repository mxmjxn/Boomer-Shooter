# Boomer Shooter Sample

This repository contains a small first-person shooter example built using the **Godot Engine**. It includes example characters, objects, and levels together with a few editor plug‑ins.

## Requirements
- **Godot Engine 4.x** – the project file lists features for version `4.4` as seen in `project.godot`.

## Getting Started
1. Install Godot 4.x.
2. Clone this repository or download the sources.
3. Launch Godot and open `project.godot` from the project list.
4. Press **Play** (or `F5`) to run `Levels/main_scene.tscn`.

The main scene already references the player and environment so it will start immediately.

## Included Plug‑ins
- **Script‑IDE** – transforms the script editor into a more full‑featured IDE with tabbed editing and an improved outline.
- **SimpleGrassTextured** – tools for painting simple textured grass onto 3D terrain.

Both plug‑ins are enabled by default as noted in `project.godot`.
